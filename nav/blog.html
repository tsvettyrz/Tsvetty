		<p>Beauty blogs are to the beauty world as food is to humans – essential. What would the beauty world be without the best beauty blogs? </p>
		<p>We empower hairstylists, cosmetologists, estheticians, nail technicians, massage therapists, makeup artists and other beauty professionals to take charge of their lives and their businesses. To continue empowering beauty professionals, we use our blog as a resource for salon design inspiration, marketing tips for salon owners, and general business tips. 
		<p>Keeping up with all the latest beauty trends won’t necessarily give you glowing skin, fabulous hair, or picture-perfect makeup… but it sure does give you an inside peek at all the cool new products, techniques, and trending styles that might just help you get a bit closer to all of the above. A great way to stay on top of the latest and greatest the beauty industry has to offer is to stay tuned into some of the most popular beauty blogs out there.</p>
		<p>We’re always looking for inspiration, advice, tips, and tricks. Check out our blogs!</p>
