		<p>There are over 80,000 beauty establishments for customers to choose from when it comes to a new haircut or a manicure.</p>
		<p>This means that your salon’s success depends not only on its technical skills and creativity but also your ability to reach (and retain) new customers.</p>
		<p>Whether it’s Yelp, Facebook, or word of mouth, there are plenty of ways to discover a new salon. So we surveyed 1,800 U.S. consumers to learn exactly how they do it. (We also asked consumers why they would decide to try a salon and then recommend it to their friends.)</p>
		<p>Here’s what we found:</p>
		<h2>Personal recommendations and online reviews rule</h2>
		<p>When it comes to finding a new salon, personal recommendations are key. Nearly two-thirds of people said they are most likely to ask friends and family for a recommendation, and a personal recommendation is important to some degree for 92 percent of people surveyed.</p>
		<p>The second-most preferred method of finding a salon is through online reviews posted by customers. Interestingly, nearly half of the people surveyed said they trust other customers’ reviews more than they trust reviews written by professionals.</p>
		<p>The content of those reviews is important, too. Seventy-seven percent of people said it’s very or extremely important that a reliable review includes specific details about the products or services someone has purchased.</p>
		<h2>Reviews aren’t from where you’d think</h2>
		<p>The biggest group of consumers (28 percent) said that Google Reviews is their favorite source for online reviews.</p>
		<p>Google Reviews are built into the online discovery process, which could explain this preference. Whenever consumers perform a search on Google, they see Google Reviews. If a consumer wants to find the best ladies’ salon in the city, for example, and googles it, the first thing that comes up at the top of the results page is a list of local salons with star ratings from customers.</p>
		<p>After Google Reviews, the next favorite online review sites are Facebook and Yelp. And consumers are checking these online platforms regularly for recommendations — over 20 percent reported looking up reviews on a website or app a few times per week, while almost a quarter reported checking a few times per month.</p>
		<h2>Have a solid social media presence</h2>
		<p>Building your brand on social media is an important aspect of marketing, especially when it comes to hair styling and beauty. Create a strong presence online, and ensure that you (and/or your employees) update it regularly.</p>
		<h2>Request feedback</h2>
		<p>How are you doing? When customers know that you take their feedback seriously, they know you care. </p>
		<p>The happier your customers are, and the more responsive you are to feedback, the more likely you are to have customers singing your praises to their friends and family.</p>
