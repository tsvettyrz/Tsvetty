		<p>Your dream business might feel far away when you start a salon, but creating an actionable plan can help. With a salon business plan, you’ll achieve your objectives, stay focused, and be successful.Here’s how to create a salon business plan that will help you get off the ground.</p>
		<h2>Start with an executive summary</h2>
		<p>An executive summary serves as your plan’s overview. Think of the summary as a clear, concise preview for the reader of what’s to come. Your executive summary should include the objectives of your salon and your mission statement. Use it to paint the big picture.</p>
		<p>The summary should include your business keys to success. For example, you’ll need a talented staff that can provide good customer service. You’ll also want a comforting environment so your patrons enjoy being there and want to come back. Writing these down will help you live them out later on.</p>
		<h2>Company description</h2>
		<p>Your company description should include the most important parts of your salon, like the theme/concept, location, and your target market. Think of this section as the “who, what, when, where, and why” of your business.</p>
		<p>A concept salon may be a salon that exclusively cuts kids’ hair or only does blowouts. If you specialize in a certain cut or you plan to be more upscale vs. everyday, write out how your salon fits into one of these categories.</p>
		<p>Your salon’s location is also part the description. A solid location is key to attracting new customers and keeping them coming back. Determine how much foot traffic your storefront will have, whether your customers have access to parking, or if there’s nearby public transportation. Surrounding businesses can be of help as well — you might partner with other local shops or restaurants for special events or promotions.</p>
		<h2>Market Analysis</h2>
		<p>Show that you know your stuff by providing insights and trends into the beauty industry along with your market analysis. A market analysis looks at the size of the market both in volume and in value, the competition, and the economic environment in terms of barriers to entry and regulation (this can be done qualitatively and quantitatively).</p>
		<p>Then, provide a competitive analysis of your market and location. You’ll want to include who has the biggest market share, how close your other competitors’ salons are to yours, and what advantages you’ll have over the competition.</p>
		<p>Finish this section with a SWOT analysis that will expand further on what your business does well and what might threaten your success. A SWOT analysis is a process used to identify:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strengths – What does your business do well? What’s your competitive advantage? What resources do you have?</li>
			<li>Weaknesses – What might limit your ability to gain the competitive advantage? Where can you improve? What inhibits your sales?</li>
			<li>Opportunities – Are there changes in the market? Are there new industry trends you can take advantage of?</li>
			<li>Threats – What obstacles do you face? If you’re a salon that plans to make a lot of money on keratin treatments but Magic Sleek is on the rise, you should plan for that.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Promotions</h2>
		<p>You’ll need a promotion strategy so new customers know you exist.</p>
		<p>You want to start by making sure you have your digital channels up and running. A website is key, as are profiles on review sites. And don’t forget about social media.</p>
		<p>Social media is a low-cost way to acquire new customers and increase the visibility of your brand. Think about how you will use each channel. Facebook: what type of content you’ll be posting. Twitter: to find new customers.</p>
		<p>Think about how you’ll run regular campaigns on these channels to get people through the door.</p>
