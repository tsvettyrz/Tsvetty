		<h2>More about our HIFU Facial Treatment</h2>
		<p>The facelift technique we use in our London clinic uses the 4D Meso thread, also known as "thread lifting." This is a non-surgical technique that's the favourite of many people because the rejuvenation effect is immediate, long lasting, and there's no need for painful surgery. Another technique we use is the HIFU (high intensity focused ultrasound) treatment.</p>
		<h2>How Does HIFU Facial Treatment Work?</h2>
		<p><abbr title="High Intensity Focused Ultrasound">HIFU</abbr> also known as ‘Ultrasound Facelift’ or ‘Ultherapy’, is a non-surgical face treatment. During the procedure, focused ultrasound energy is used to lift the muscule and tighten the skin. The ultrasound generates low levels of heat in the targeted skin. With just 1 treatment, the results are remarkable and can last between 2 to 4 years. HIFU stimulates the creation of collagen that gives skin its youthfulness by keeping it firmed, toned and elastic. This is the highest level of non-surgical technology available. HIFU be combined with other treatments. For the best lifting effect it is often used with Thread facelift to give an optimum result.</p>
		<h2>How Does Thread Lifting Work?</h2>
		<p>The meso thread is laid into the skin using a flexible needle that leaves no trace. The flexible high-tech material that the thread is made of allows the physician to model it at different depths. The threads remain within the body after treatment, and as a natural response to the presence of a foreign article, will be surrounded by a capsule of collagen fibres.</p>
		<p>These fibres form a natural "frame" for the soft tissues, and as the facial muscles weaken over time (a process known as ptosis), the frame will protect the skin, preventing the formation and deepening of wrinkles. The new cells formed in this way lead to extra blood flow, and a tissue enriched with nutrients and oxygen, meaning your face will look fresher and younger.</p>
		<p>The thread will be completely absorbed by the body within nine months, and the rejuvenation effect will last for between one and a half to two years without any further stimulation. With careful reinforcement, the effect may persist for longer.</p>
