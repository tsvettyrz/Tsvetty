		<h2>LED Light Treatment in Truly Relaxing Surroundings</h2>

An LED facial is non-invasive and completely free from pain, while also reaching several layers deep in order to boost the skin's natural healing process, stimulate the production of collagen to reduce gauntness and even battle the types of bacteria which produce acne.</p>
		<p>There is more than one reason why this space-age treatment has become so popular with the Hollywood elite and household-name beauticians around the world.</p>
		<h2>Why is LED light therapy better than other similar treatments?</h2>
		<p>Which type of treatment will be best for you will depend on your personal needs and the qualities of your skin. Many people prefer LED light therapy - like the celebrity clients of Joanna Vargas, New York and LA beautician supremo - because it is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Completely non-invasive, yet of proven effectiveness</li>
			<li>Useful when used for skin lightening, to promote healing after various facial peels and more</li>
			<li>A relaxing process which does not feel claustrophobic in any way</li>
			<li>Gentle in its effects, achieving the greatest progress with ongoing use over several sessions</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Price: ‎£2.00 (per minute)</p>
