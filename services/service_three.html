		<h1>Carboxytherapy</h1>
		<img src="images/service_three.jpg" alt="Carboxytherapy" title="Carboxytherapy" width="350" height="200" align="right">
		<p>Carboxytherapy is a non-surgical clinical and cosmetic treatment. It uses injections to transfuse gaseous carbon dioxide below the skin through a needle. The <b>carboxy</b> treatment has a necrotizing effect on fatty deposit, regenerates the skin's elasticity, stimulates blood flow and decreases the appearance of cellulite. For fat and cellulite reducing, the procedure is often favoured over more high-risk methods, such as liposuction.</p>
		<h2>How does Carboxytherapy work?</h2>
		<p>As we age, blood flow in the dermis is decreased which means that the cells received less oxygen. As a result, the collagen reproduction and cells creation slow down. Injecting carbon dioxide gas under the skin can improve blood circulation to a specific area which will help the red blood cells to rush to the area. When the blood cells reach the location, they create an increase in circulation which helps for:</p>

			<li>Stretch marks;</li>
			<li>Cellulite;</li>
			<li>Under-eye circles;</li>
			<li>Alopecia.</li>	
		</ul>
		<h2>What body areas can be treated with Carboxytherapy?</h2>
		<p><b>Carboxytherapy treatment</b> is suited for striae, cellulite, fatty, skin loose, wrinkle decrease and eye' s dark circles. It can be performed on any body's areas but the most common are stomach, arms, legs, face, eyelids, neck.</p>
		<p>In addition to the above mentioned areas of the body on which Carboxytherapy can be performed, we have specialized procedures targeting stretch marks and cellulite :</p>
		<h3>Carboxytherapy for Stretch Marks</h3>
		<p>Striae Distensae or more widely known as stretch marks are areas of the skin with damage and tearing as a result of rapid gain or loss of body mass. Mostly associated with pregnancy, these marks on the surface of the skin will typically fade over time and heal for the most part, will never completely disappear.</p>
		<h3>Carboxytherapy for Cellulite</h3>
		<p>This fat tissue build up is observed mostly in women and is a mechanism designed to assist the nurturing and development of a new life in the human body. The skin structure and body fat accumulation is a process that is dependent mostly on hormone distribution, therefore cellulite build up is not affected by exercise and other conventional weight loss techniques.</p>
		<h3>Side effects from the Carboxytherapy?</h3>
		<p>Carboxytherapy treatment is a nearly safe procedure with relatively no side effects. People may have bruising which should clear up within a week. As an advice to the people who get the procedure for fat loss or cellulite: Don't immerse yourself in water for 24 hours, including swimming or using a bathtub.</p>
